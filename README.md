# 🎯 Word Masters

**Word Masters** is a browser-based word puzzle game inspired by the popular game **Wordle**.  
Players have **six attempts** to guess a **secret five-letter English word**, with visual feedback provided after each guess.

This project is built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, and integrates with a real-world API to fetch and validate words.

> ⚠️ Unlike the original demo, this version is **fully responsive** and works smoothly on **mobile devices**.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. A secret **five-letter word** is chosen by the system.
2. You have **6 guesses** to find the correct word.
3. After each guess, letters are highlighted:
   - 🟩 **Green** → Correct letter in the correct position
   - 🟨 **Yellow** → Correct letter but wrong position
   - ⬜ **Gray** → Letter not in the word
4. Duplicate letters are handled accurately.
5. Guess the word correctly to **win**.
6. Fail after six attempts and the game reveals the correct word.
